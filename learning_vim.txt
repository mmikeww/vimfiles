Some text objects are similar to some motions, but

You don't need to adjust the cursor

dw - delete from the cursor to the next word (so, to delete a word, you have to move the cursor at the beginnig of the word)
daw - delete a word regardless of the cursor position
You'll be able to edit more effectively with text objects




http://takac.github.io/2013/01/30/vim-grammar/

w,W - word OBJECT, not to be confused with the MOVEMENT
In context this has to be used with the a or i modifiers, just like any other text object, and it will affect the whole word/WORD regardless of cursor placement.

When daw is used and the cursor is in the middle of a word, it affects the whole word and the leading whitespace. This is different and must not be confused with the behaviour of dw which is delete till.. end of movement.

consider
copy a string with yi"
move to new location and delete inside quotes with di"
when you try to paste with p you will just put back wht you deleted because the d command also copies
"one"      "two"       "three"
solutions:
1. yanking always copies to the 0 register, so you can paste with "0p
2. delete without saving to register with "_d

http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/registers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-parts/
perhaps create a <leader>d mapping to do this
3. use visual mode to select instead of using d command:   vi"p
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Replace_a_word_with_yanked_text
i like this (#3) the best. consider the normal usage: select/highlight text, ctrlc, highlight text to replace, ctrlv
however, the downside is that the text that you paste over is now in the yank buffer, 
so if you try to repeat by doing vi"p again, you wont be pasting in the original yank.
BUT, YOU CAN REMAP 'P' IN VISUAL MODE:
vnoremap p "_dp
vnoremap P "_dP
FROM: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12625722/vim-toggling-buffer-overwrite-behavior-when-deleting/
4. use ctrlR in insert mode to paste from register 0:   ci"<C-r>0   then repeat with . dot
but <c-r> is a difficult press and then i need to <c-[> to exit insert mode
from same wikia link
maybe map this ci"<C-r>0 command, but i won't always want to use " text obj
can create an insert mode mapping to auto paste in, maybe ctrl+v?
inoremap <c-v> <c-r>0
5. or just use any specific register   :help registers
http://www.usevim.com/2012/04/13/registers/
6. use yankring plugin or yankstack, yankstack seems simpler and less intrusive
yankstack allows me to do vi"p repeatedly . alt+p to cycle
7. maybe just remap d to "_d directly and forget about it
this guy does it https://github.com/terryma/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc
and i think he will use visual mode to select and then 'x' command to 'cut'
8. ReplaceWithRegister plugin - LOOK INTO THIS
9. set up a freenode acct and ask in IRC #vim
10. easy clip plugin   https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-easyclip

so i think i will use vi"p with yankstack, and fallback on ci"<c-r>0 if i need to do it repeatedly 
so that i can use the . dot command.

problem with both vi"p and <c-r>0<c-[> is the two pinky keypresses at the end, its inconvenient
but in my "hello" "one" "two" example above, i should be using viw and ciw isntead

also:
http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html
"If only a few locations need changing, a quick method is to use the * command to find the next occurrence of the word and use cw to change the word. Then type n to find the next word and . (dot) to repeat the cw command."

in insert mode, ctrl-p and ctrl-x for word completion




while within a block, these will take you to the matching brace
[{
]}


append text at the end of a word
ea
or start of the word
bi
these will allow me to surround a word without using surround plugin


use KATAS to practice
string calc kata 


in insert mode, Ctrl+O allows one normal mode command
so, can navigate to start / end of lines with:
<C-O>^ or <C-O>I
<C-O>$ or <C-O>A
but i guess its just as easy to press <C-[>A

  one way is use bi and ea

http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3apwc1/vim_noob_append_5_characters_ahead/csevbqq

There are many ways to move the cursor within a line. I only find myself moving character-wise (5l) in rare circumstances. There are some situations where it makes sense, but usually I want to append to the current word (ea), or after the next comma (f,a), or insert before the last pipe (F|i), or after the previous whitespace character (Bi), or before the word "apple" (/apple<CR>i).
