Marks are great, but don't fall into the trap of over using your shiny new
toys for every problem at hand.  Take for example the operation of deleting
everything from the current cursor to a word you can see a few lines below in
your document.  Having just learned about marks, it might seem like a good idea
to do this:
>
    ma/foo<CR>d`a
<
But there's a much better way to do that:
>
    d/foo<CR>
<
You're going to jump to your practice file and try that out now, aren't you? ;)
See |setting-up-a-practice-file| if you haven't done so already.
